<p>Hi. I am a page template.</p>
<p>Logic here is: If I see a shortcode or set of shortcodes in here, I will do only them
  and no surrounding the_content(), but have to get the output to be rss, which means maybe
  that has to go on the shortcode itself here, like [wreader template="Pop" format="rss"]

<p>No that's not right. Because the page may have a whole layout we have to grock. 

<p>And RSS is just one big list.
